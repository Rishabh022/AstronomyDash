                    <h2>What is a meteor shower?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A meteor shower occurs when a number of meteors seem to radiate (or shoot out from) the same
                        point in the sky. They are usually named for the constellation in which their radiant appears.
                        The meteoroids in a shower usually come from the trail of debris left behind by a comet. In the
                        case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scattered by
                        orbiting asteroids. When Earth’s orbit intersects the dust trail, we see more meteors flaring as
                        the cometary debris encounters our planet’s atmosphere.

                    <h2>Facts about Meteor Showers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Most meteor showers are caused by debris from comets. When Earth moves through those debris
                        trails, we see increased numbers of comets. Two meteor showers are caused by debris shed by
                        asteroids. The Quadrantids are very likely caused by debris from the minor planet 2003 EH1. The
                        Geminid meteor shower comes from debris shed by asteroid 3200 Phaethon. The Orionid Meteor
                        shower (which occurs in late October each year) is created by dust and debris left behind by the
                        passage of Comet 1P/Halley. Meteors fall to Earth during the day, although we can’t see them. It
                        is very rare that a meteorite will strike a human being. It’s more likely that it will fall into
                        the ocean. The best time to view a meteor shower is in the early morning hours, preferably on a
                        dark, moonless night. The earliest record of the Perseids meteor shower is found in Chinese
                        annals from 36 AD.

                    <h2>Famous Meteor Showers</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are several famous and easy-to-observe meteor showers. The Perseids occur in mid-August
                        when Earth encounters the debris trail from Comet Swift-Tuttle. They appear to radiate from a
                        point in the constellation Perseus. The shower lasts from mid-July to late August, with a peak
                        around August 12th each year. The Leonid meteor shower can be a very busy one. It occurs each
                        year in mid-November and rains debris from Comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. In 1833, observers estimated
                        that hundreds of thousands of meteors flared through the sky. Observers wait for it each year,
                        hoping for another spectacular show, emanating from the direction of the constellation Leo. The
                        Geminid meteor shower occurs in December when Earth crosses the path of the asteroid 3200
                        Phaethon. The meteors appear to come from the direction of the constellation Gemini, and
                        observers have noted that they move more slowly than other meteors.
