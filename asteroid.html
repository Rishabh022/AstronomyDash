                    <h2>Understanding Asteroids: Celestial Remnants in Our Solar System</h2>
                    <p>Asteroids, small rocky bodies in our solar system, occupy interplanetary space up to the orbit of
                        Jupiter. These minor planets, smaller than moons, provide crucial insights into the formation of
                        our solar system.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Composition Classes of Asteroids:</h2>
                    <p>Asteroids exhibit three main composition classes. C-types (chondrites) consist of clay and
                        silicate rocks. S-types, known as "stony" asteroids, are primarily made of silicate rocks and
                        nickel-iron mixtures. M-types are metallic nickel-iron asteroids, indicating their formation
                        distance from the Sun in the early solar system.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Fascinating Facts about Asteroids:</h2>
                    <p>Asteroids offer valuable clues about the rocky planets' formation 4.5 billion years ago. Here are
                        some intriguing facts about these celestial bodies:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Asteroids and comets contribute over 100 tons of material to Earth daily, mostly burning up in
                        our atmosphere. Impacting the ground, if it occurs, is termed a meteorite.
                        Asteroid impacts were more frequent in the past, with a significant impact contributing to the
                        extinction of dinosaurs 65 million years ago.
                        Earth encounters a football field-sized object impact approximately once every 2,000 years.
                        A car-sized meteoroid falls into Earth's atmosphere about once a year, resulting in a beautiful
                        fireball but usually burning up before reaching the ground.
                        Asteroids are rich in precious metals, water, and other metals.
                        Some asteroids are remnants of blown-out comets, with the ices gone, leaving only rocky
                        material.
                        Some asteroids have moons of their own, adding to their celestial allure.
                        Most asteroids orbit the Sun in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter, also known as minor
                        planets or planetoids.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Near-Earth Asteroids & Impact Dynamics:</h2>
                    <p>Asteroids continue to approach Earth, termed Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) or Potentially Hazardous
                        Asteroids (PHAs). Astronomers diligently monitor these objects, assessing potential impacts and
                        collaborating on strategies to mitigate possible damage.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Famous Asteroids:</h2>
                    <p>Notable asteroids include 1 Ceres (952 km across), 2 Pallas (544 km), and 4 Vesta (580 km). These
                        rocky minor planets have captivated astronomers' attention since the 1800s, providing valuable
                        insights into our solar system's history and evolution.</p>
