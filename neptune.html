                    <h2>Discovery of Neptune</h2>
                    <p>Neptune was not known to the ancients. It is not visible to the naked eye and was first observed
                        in 1846. Its position was determined using mathematical predictions. It was named after the
                        Roman god of the sea.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Rotation and Size</h2>
                    <p>Neptune spins on its axis very rapidly. Its equatorial clouds take 16 hours to make one rotation.
                        This is because Neptune is not a solid body. Neptune is the smallest of the ice giants. Despite
                        being smaller than Uranus, Neptune has a greater mass. Below its heavy atmosphere, Uranus is
                        made of layers of hydrogen, helium, and methane gases. They enclose a layer of water, ammonia,
                        and methane ice. The inner core of the planet is made of rock.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Atmosphere and Climate</h2>
                    <p>The atmosphere of Neptune is made of hydrogen and helium, with some methane. The methane absorbs
                        red light, which makes the planet appear a lovely blue. High, thin clouds drift in the upper
                        atmosphere. Neptune has a very active climate. Large storms whirl through its upper atmosphere,
                        and high-speed winds track around the planet at up to 600 meters per second. One of the largest
                        storms ever seen was recorded in 1989. It was called the Great Dark Spot, and it lasted about
                        five years.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Rings and Moons</h2>
                    <p>Neptune has a very thin collection of rings. They are likely made up of ice particles mixed with
                        dust grains and possibly coated with a carbon-based substance. Neptune has 14 moons. The most
                        interesting moon is Triton, a frozen world that is spewing nitrogen ice and dust particles out
                        from below its surface. It was likely captured by the gravitational pull of Neptune. It is
                        probably the coldest world in the solar system.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Spacecraft Exploration</h2>
                    <p>Only one spacecraft has flown by Neptune. In 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft swept past the
                        planet. It returned the first close-up images of the Neptune system. The NASA/ESA Hubble Space
                        Telescope has also studied this planet, as have a number of ground-based telescopes.</p>
