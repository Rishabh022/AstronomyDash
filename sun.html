                    <p>The Sun is the star at the centre of our solar system. It is an almost perfect sphere of
                        super-hot gases whose gravity holds the solar system together. The energy produced by the Sun is
                        essential for life on Earth and is a driving force behind the Earth’s weather.</p>

                    <h2>The Sun Contains 99.86% of the Mass in the Solar System</h2>
                    <p>The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth. It is almost three
                        quarters Hydrogen, whilst most of the remaining mass is Helium.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Sun is an Almost Perfect Sphere</h2>
                    <p>There is a 10-kilometre difference between the Sun’s polar and equatorial diameter. This means it
                        is
                        the closest thing to a perfect sphere that has been observed in nature.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Sun Will Consume the Earth</h2>
                    <p>When the Sun has burned all its Hydrogen, it will continue to burn helium for 130 million more
                        years.
                        During this time, it will expand to the point that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and the Earth.
                        At
                        this stage, it will have become a red giant.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Sun Will One Day Be About the Size of Earth</h2>
                    <p>After its red giant phase, the Sun will collapse. It will keep its enormous mass with the
                        approximate
                        volume of our planet. When this happens, it will have become a white dwarf.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Temperature Inside the Sun Can Reach 15 Million Degrees Celsius</h2>
                    <p>Energy is generated at the Sun’s core, by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen converts to Helium. Hot
                        objects
                        expand; the Sun would explode if it were not for its enormous gravitational force. The
                        temperature
                        on the surface of the Sun is closer to 5,600 degrees Celsius.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Light from the Sun Takes Eight Minutes to Reach Earth</h2>
                    <p>The Sun is an average distance of 150 million kilometres from the Earth. Light travels at 300,000
                        kilometres per second. Dividing one by the other gives us an approximate time of 500 seconds (or
                        eight minutes and 20 seconds). Although this energy reaches Earth in a few minutes, it will
                        already
                        have taken millions of years to travel from the Sun’s core to its surface.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Sun Travels at 220 Kilometres Per Second</h2>
                    <p>The Sun is 24,000-26,000 light years from the galactic centre. It takes the Sun 225-250 million
                        years
                        to complete an orbit of the centre of the Milky Way.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Distance from the Sun to Earth Changes Throughout the Year</h2>
                    <p>This is because the Earth travels on an elliptical orbit around the Sun. The distance between the
                        two
                        bodies varies from 147 to 152 million kilometres.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Sun is Middle-Aged</h2>
                    <p>At around 4.6 billion years old, the Sun has already burned off about half of its store of
                        Hydrogen.
                        It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for approximately 5 billion years. The Sun is
                        currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Sun Has a Very Strong Magnetic Field</h2>
                    <p>Magnetic energy released by the Sun during magnetic storms causes solar flares. We see these as
                        sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines twist and they spin, much like a tornado would on
                        Earth.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Sun Generates Solar Wind</h2>
                    <p>The wind is a stream of charged particles. This travels at approximately 450 kilometres per
                        second
                        through the solar system. Solar wind occurs when the magnetic field of the Sun extends into
                        space.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Sol is the Latin for Sun</h2>
                    <p>This is where the word “solar” comes from, which is used to describe things that are derived
                        from,
                        related to, or caused by the Sun.</p>
