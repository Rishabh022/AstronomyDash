                    <h2>The Dark Side of the Moon is a Myth</h2>
                    <p>In reality, both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight; however, only one face of the
                        Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around its own axis in exactly
                        the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The
                        side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Rise and Fall of the Tides on Earth is Caused by the Moon</h2>
                    <p>There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational pull that the Moon exerts; one on the
                        side facing the Moon, and the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon. The
                        bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.
                    </p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Moon is Drifting Away from the Earth</h2>
                    <p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet every year. It is estimated that it
                        will continue to do so for around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will be
                        taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>A Person Would Weigh Much Less on the Moon</h2>
                    <p>The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about
                        one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound
                        so high in the air.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Moon has Only Been Walked on by 12 People; All American Men</h2>
                    <p>The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong on the Apollo 11 mission, while
                        the last man to walk on the Moon in 1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then,
                        the Moon has only been visited by unmanned vehicles.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Moon has No Atmosphere</h2>
                    <p>This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites, and solar
                        winds, and has huge temperature variations. The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard
                        on the Moon, and the sky always appears black.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Moon has Quakes</h2>
                    <p>These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar astronauts used seismographs on
                        their visits to the Moon and found that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the
                        surface, causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten core, just like
                        Earth.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The First Spacecraft to Reach the Moon was Luna 1 in 1959</h2>
                    <p>This was a Soviet craft, which was launched from the USSR. It passed within 5995 km of the
                        surface of the Moon before going into orbit around the Sun.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>The Moon is the Fifth Largest Natural Satellite in the Solar System</h2>
                    <p>At 3,475 km in diameter, the Moon is much smaller than the major moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
                        Earth is about 80 times the volume than the Moon, but both are about the same age. A prevailing
                        theory is that the Moon was once part of the Earth and was formed from a chunk that broke away
                        due to a huge object colliding with Earth when it was relatively young.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>During the 1950’s the USA Considered Detonating a Nuclear Bomb on the Moon</h2>
                    <p>The secret project during the height of the cold war was known as “A Study of Lunar Research
                        Flights” or “Project A119” and meant as a show of strength at a time they were lagging behind in
                        the space race.</p>
