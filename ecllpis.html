                    <h2>What is a Solar Eclipse?</h2>
                    <p>
                        A solar eclipse is a natural event that takes place on Earth when the Moon moves in its orbit
                        between Earth and the Sun (this is also known as an occultation). It happens at New Moon when
                        the Sun and Moon are in conjunction with each other. If the Moon was only slightly closer to
                        Earth, and orbited in the same plane and its orbit was circular, we would see eclipses each
                        month. The lunar orbit is elliptical and tilted with respect to Earth’s orbit, so we can only
                        see up to 5 eclipses per year. Depending on the geometry of the Sun, Moon, and Earth, the Sun
                        can be totally blocked, or it can be partially blocked.

                    <h2>Facts about Solar Eclipses</h2>
                    <p>
                        Depending on the geometry of the Sun, Moon, and Earth, there can be between 2 and 5 solar
                        eclipses each year. Totality occurs when the Moon completely obscures the Sun so only the solar
                        corona is showing. A total solar eclipse can happen once every 1-2 years, making them very rare
                        events. The longest a total solar eclipse can last is 7.5 minutes. The width of the path of
                        totality is usually about 160 km across and can sweep across an area of Earth’s surface about
                        10,000 miles long. Almost identical eclipses occur after 18 years and 11 days. This period of
                        223 synodic months is called a saros. During a total solar eclipse, conditions in the path of
                        totality can change quickly. Air temperatures drop, and the immediate area becomes dark. If any
                        planets are in the sky at the time of a total solar eclipse, they can be seen as points of
                        light.

                    <h2>Solar Eclipse Types</h2>
                    <p>
                        Solar eclipses can be of different types based on their characteristics and the position of the
                        Moon and Sun. The main types include partial, total, and annular solar eclipses.

                    <h2>Total Solar Eclipse:</h2>
                    <p>During a total solar eclipse, the Moon completely blocks the solar disk, creating a "zone of
                        totality." Observers in this path witness a darkened Sun with the solar corona visible,
                        experiencing phenomena like "Bailey’s Beads" and solar prominences. This is the only time it's
                        safe to look directly at the Sun, as other observations require special solar filters.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Annular Solar Eclipse:</h2>
                    <p>Not every solar eclipse is total; an annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is farther away,
                        creating a ring of sunlight around it. Annularity can last from 5 to 12 minutes. Observers need
                        eye protection throughout, even during annularity.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Partial Solar Eclipse:</h2>
                    <p>In a partial solar eclipse, Earth passes through the lunar penumbra, allowing the Sun to be
                        partially blocked. The degree of coverage varies, from a small sliver to nearly total. Always
                        use approved filters or indirect viewing methods to safely observe any eclipse.</p>
