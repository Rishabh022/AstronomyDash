                    <h2>Pluto: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Dwarf Planet</h2>
                    <p>Named after the Roman god of the underworld, Pluto has a fascinating history and characteristics
                        that set it apart.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Discovery and Reclassification:</h2>
                    <p>Pluto was discovered on February 18th, 1930, by the Lowell Observatory. It faced a significant
                        reclassification in 2006, when the International Astronomical Union (IAU) refined the definition
                        of a planet, leading to Pluto's classification as a dwarf planet.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Moons and Size:</h2>
                    <p>Pluto boasts five known moons, including Charon, Hydra, Nix, Kerberos, and Styx. Despite being
                        the largest dwarf planet, Pluto is smaller than several moons, with intriguing features such as
                        mountain ranges and craters.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Composition and Eccentric Orbit:</h2>
                    <p>Comprising one-third water, primarily in the form of ice, Pluto's surface is covered with various
                        ices, rock, and distinct surface features. It has an eccentric and inclined orbit, periodically
                        bringing it closer to the Sun than Neptune.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>New Horizons Mission:</h2>
                    <p>The New Horizons spacecraft, launched in 2006, provided unprecedented insights into Pluto. On
                        July 14th, 2015, it captured images and measurements, continuing its journey to explore the
                        Kuiper Belt.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Atmospheric Dynamics:</h2>
                    <p>Pluto exhibits atmospheric dynamics, with a thin atmosphere primarily composed of nitrogen.
                        During its elliptical orbit, closer proximity to the Sun leads to the formation of a temporary
                        atmosphere that eventually freezes back to its solid state as Pluto moves away from the Sun.</p>
                    <br>

                        2021 and may be subject to updates.</p>
