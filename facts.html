                            The Sun is the star at the centre of our solar system. It is an almost perfect sphere of
                            super-hot gases whose gravity holds the solar system together. The energy produced by the
                            Sun is
                            essential for life on Earth and is a driving force behind the Earth’s weather.

                        <p>
                            Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and due to its proximity it is not easily seen
                            except
                            during twilight. For every two orbits of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about
                            its
                            axis and up until 1965 it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly faced the
                            Sun.
                            Thirteen times a century Mercury can be observed from the Earth passing across the face of
                            the
                            Sun in an event called a transit, the next will occur on the 9th May 2016.
