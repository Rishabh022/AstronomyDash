                    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It’s not visible to the naked eye, and became the
                        first planet discovered with the use of a telescope. Uranus is tipped over on its side with an
                        axial tilt of 98 degrees. It is often described as “rolling around the Sun on its side.”</p>

                    <h2>Discovery of Uranus</h2>
                    <p>Uranus was officially discovered by Sir William Herschel in 1781. It is too dim to have been seen
                        by the ancients. At first, Herschel thought it was a comet, but several years later it was
                        confirmed as a planet. Herschel tried to have his discovery named “Georgian Sidus” after King
                        George III. The name Uranus was suggested by astronomer Johann Bode. The name comes from the
                        ancient Greek deity Ouranos.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Rotation and Orbit</h2>
                    <p>Uranus turns on its axis once every 17 hours, 14 minutes. The planet rotates in a retrograde
                        direction, opposite to the way Earth and most other planets turn. Uranus makes one trip around
                        the Sun every 84 Earth years. During some parts of its orbit, one or the other of its poles
                        point directly at the Sun and get about 42 years of direct sunlight. The rest of the time, they
                        are in darkness.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Composition and Temperature</h2>
                    <p>Uranus is often referred to as an “ice giant” planet. Like the other gas giants, it has a
                        hydrogen upper layer, which has helium mixed in. Below that is an icy “mantle, which surrounds a
                        rock and ice core. The upper atmosphere is made of water, ammonia, and the methane ice crystals
                        that give the planet its pale blue color. Uranus hits the coldest temperatures of any planet.
                        With a minimum atmospheric temperature of -224°C, Uranus is nearly the coldest planet in the
                        solar system. While Neptune doesn’t get as cold as Uranus, it is, on average, colder. The upper
                        atmosphere of Uranus is covered by a methane haze which hides the storms that take place in the
                        cloud decks.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Rings and Moons</h2>
                    <p>Uranus has two sets of very thin dark-colored rings. The ring particles are small, ranging from
                        dust-sized particles to small boulders. There are eleven inner rings and two outer rings. They
                        probably formed when one or more of Uranus’s moons were broken up in an impact. The first rings
                        were discovered in 1977 with the two outer rings being discovered in Hubble Space Telescope
                        images between 2003 and 2005. Uranus’ moons are named after characters created by William
                        Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. These include Oberon, Titania, and Miranda. All are frozen
                        worlds with dark surfaces. Some are ice and rock mixtures. The most interesting Uranian moon is
                        Miranda; it has ice canyons, terraces, and other strange-looking surface areas.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Spacecraft Exploration</h2>
                    <p>Only one spacecraft has flown by Uranus. In 1986, the Voyager 2 spacecraft swept past the planet
                        at a distance of 81,500 km. It returned the first close-up images of the planet, its moons, and
                        rings.</p>
